an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, author and Director of Research at the Centre for Theoretical
 Cosmology within the University of Cambridge.[16][17] His scientific works include a collaboration with Roger 
 Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction 
 that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set forth a theory of cosmology 
 explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He is a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds 
 interpretation of quantum mechanics.</p><a class="heroes" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" target="-blank"> Read More</a>
